We love that you're interested in contributing to this project!

**This fork of TwUI is feature-frozen.** Only _critical bug fixes_ will be
accepted, and most significant changes in behavior will be rejected. We'd prefer
to focus feature work on
[Rebel](https://github.com/blog/1300-rebel-a-framework-for-improving-appkit).

## Prefer Pull Requests

If you know exactly how to fix the bug being reported, please open a pull
request instead of an issue. Pull requests are easier than patches or inline
code blocks for discussing and merging the changes.

If you can't make the change yourself, please open an issue after making sure
that one isn't already logged.

## Contributing Code

All code contributions should match our [coding
conventions](https://github.com/github/objective-c-conventions).

Thanks for contributing! :boom::camel:
